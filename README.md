# ReFaceLab: Transformative Identity Simulation Tool
ReFaceLab is an AI-driven project leveraging pre-trained StyleGAN2 to simulate and recognize transformations in facial appearances, enhancing identity detection under disguises. By enabling manipulation of facial attributes like hairstyles, accessories, and age, it builds a robust framework for facial analysis.


## Features

- Attribute Simulation: Alters facial hair, hairstyles, accessories, and age to create realistic identity variations.
- Latent Space Manipulation: Fine-tunes StyleGAN2 latent vectors for precise attribute changes.
- Grid Visualization: Generates grids showcasing diverse simulated variations for analysis.
- High-Resolution Outputs: Produces clear, 256x256 resolution images for detailed study.

## Simulation Criteria (Example)
- Facial Hair: Add/remove beards, mustaches, and goatees.
- Hairstyles: Experiment with wigs, baldness, and different styles.
- Accessories: Add glasses, hats, and more.
- Age Progression/Regression: Simulate age from youth to elderly.

## Technology Stack

- Programming Language: Python
- Framework: TensorFlow (optimized for GPU acceleration).
- Model: StyleGAN2 (pre-trained).
- Visualization: Python tools like Matplotlib for output display.


## Future Enhancements
- Extended Attributes: Include expressions and lighting conditions.
- Real-Time Processing: Build a pipeline for live disguise detection.
- Web Interface: Create a user-friendly interface for testing and demonstration.
